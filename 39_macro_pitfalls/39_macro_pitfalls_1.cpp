/*
	A simple macro function, right? Wrong!

	A macro, even a macro function, is typeless. This allows you to work with any types,
	but without caring of undefined behaviors.

	This function has also a wrong way to handle. What happens, when for argument x or y or both
	a number to calculate, e.g. x = 4-9, y = 3 is given? Would you calculate (4-9)/3 => -5/3 => -1.666666667...?
	No. You would calculate 4-9/3 => 9/3 = 3 => 4-3 = 1 instead. Because "x" would be handled as 4-9 as two different
	numbers only. To fix that issue, x,y shall be written as: (x)/(y) =>	#define	DIVIDE(x,y) (x)/(y)

	By the way, this macro function has also another pitfalls. What happens, if y = 0? Dividing by 0 (for integers)
	a SIGFPE >>MAY<< be triggered, depending on the C version, OS, C compiler, ... => Depending on how to
	to compile your application, a signal may also differ to the expected fired signal.
	
	Usually, a SIGFPE (signal floating point exception) is going to raise.
	When you compile your application with optimization, e. g. -O2+, a SIGILL
	(illegal instruction (core dumped)) appears instead. You may handle this with a signal handling mechanism, however,
	what are you doing next?

	What happens, when x or y or both doesn't contain numbers?

/*
	What about this macro function? We're adding x and y. For numbers, it works almost well.
	What happens, when x or y is a char / C-string instead?
	What happens, if x and y are chars instead?
	What happens, if x and y are C-strings instead? => In our case the program didn't compile.
